{Gift in Raft} {Project LISTEN} {WORD}


The gift is in the raft.





The rat is in the raft.





The gift in the raft is not the rat.





The gift is gas.





Gas makes the raft fast.





The raft is in the draft.





No, the raft is in the drift!





The raft is fast.





The rat will not be sad.





Are you glad?
