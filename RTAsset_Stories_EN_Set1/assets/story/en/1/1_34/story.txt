{The Moon and the Cap} {Noni} {1}


All of us went to the fun fair.





Father bought brother fancy glasses.


Mother bought me a bright blue cap.


The baby got sugar candy.





On the way home, a very strong wind came.


It blew my cap away.





My cap got stuck on a branch of a big old tree.





I cried a lot.


And I did not eat my dinner.





Later that night, the moon came up.
It looked at my cap in the big old tree.





The moon tried on my cap.
It smiled happily.


I had to smile too.





After school the next day, my mother gave me a shiny new red cap.


"The moon sent it," she said.





That night, both the moon and I wore our caps and smiled.


We were happy.





Do you think the sun needs a hat?





Guess which cap I am wearing today!
