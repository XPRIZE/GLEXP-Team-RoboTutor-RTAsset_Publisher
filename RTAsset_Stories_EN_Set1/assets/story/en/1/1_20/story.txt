{My Little Goat} {Bukheye Mulongo Christopher} {1}


Where are you going my little goat?





I am going to market to buy a new coat.





"A coat for a goat?" asked the chicken.





"Can a goat have a coat?" asked the man.





Everyone will laugh at a goat with a coat!





But my little goat likes her new coat.


Goodbye goat!
