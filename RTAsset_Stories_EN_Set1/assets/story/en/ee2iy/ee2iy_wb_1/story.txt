{I see a Bee} {Project LISTEN} {WORD}


I see a bee.





Can you see the bee?





I see a green bee.





The green bee went to the oak tree.





Then, the green bee went to the zoo.





What did the green bee see?





The bee had a peek.





The bee can see a sheep!





Can you see the sheep?





I see a green bee and a green sheep.





The sheep got free.





The bee and the sheep went to the oak tree.





And went to sleep.
