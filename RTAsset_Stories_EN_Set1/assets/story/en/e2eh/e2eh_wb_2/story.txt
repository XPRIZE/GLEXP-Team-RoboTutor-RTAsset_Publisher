{The Elk} {Project LISTEN} {WORD}


An elk is big.





An elk can run fast!





A cub can not run fast.





The cub felt sad.





The cub met the elk.





The elk held its hand.





The cub held the elk's leg.





The elk led the cub to an elm.





Did the cub beg the elk?





The cub and the elk felt glad.





The elk bent to hug the cub.





The cub did not sob.





The big elk left.





Goodbye elk!





The cub must get to its den.





Goodbye cub!
