{Wrestling With My Brother} {Project LISTEN} {WORD}


My brother and I like to wrestle.





In fact, we love to wrestle.





I wrote a story about wrestling.





Here is what I wrote.





We play wrestling in our room.





First, we write our names. 





Killer Joe and Monster Mike!





We make the sound to start wrestling.





Ding Ding!





I do not hurt him.





He does not hurt me.





We wrestle for fun.





I wrap my arm around him.





I pin him on the floor.





But het gets out.





He takes my wrist.





He wraps his hand on my wrist.





Ouch!





Then I get up.





This time I get his wrist.





Slam! I got you.





But he wraps his arm around my head.





He got me!





I reach for his wrist.





But I can't get it!





My brother pins me on the floor.





He has my wrist.





I can't get up!





One, two, three!





Monster Mike Wins the Wrestling Match!





The end.
