{Dawn the Artist} {Project LISTEN} {WORD}


Dawn is an artist.





She likes to make art.





Dawn can draw.





She can draw a hawk.





She can draw the hawk's claw.





She can draw the hawk's jaw.





A jaw is the bone in your mouth.





Dawn likes to sit on her lawn.





A lawn means the grass in your yard.





She sits on the lawn to draw.





She can draw a fawn.





A fawn is a baby dear.





I saw Dawn draw a lot.





Then she had a big yawn.





Time for a nap!





The end.
