{How To Make Spaghetti} {Project LISTEN} {WORD}


"Spaghetti" is a big word.





I know.





But you can read it.





Spaghetti.





I can cook spaghetti.





Can you join me?





First you need water.





Then go to the stove.





Turn on the stove.





Mine looks like a coil.





Like a snake.





The heat makes the coil turn red.





The hot coil makes the water boil.





Wait for the water to boil.





Then dump in the spaghetti.





That's it!





Wait for it to boil.





I am glad you can join me.





Just don't get burnt by the hot coil!





The end.
