{Rob went to the Pet Shop} {Project LISTEN} {WORD}


Rob went to the pet shop.





Rob got a pet fish.





He set the fish in a dish.





He set the dish on a shelf.





The fish went splash.





Rob sat with the fish.





Rob said, "I wish I had six fish."





So Rob went to the pet shop.





Did Rob rush to the shop?





Rob got six fish.





And he got a brush!





Did Rob brush his fish?





Silly Rob!
