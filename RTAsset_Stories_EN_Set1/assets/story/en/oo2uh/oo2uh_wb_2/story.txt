{Dad's New Car} {Project LISTEN} {WORD}


Dad got a new car.





A jeep!





It looks good.





It is dark green.





Dad took me for a ride.





He put his foot on the gas.





The jeep went fast.





He put his foot on the brake.





The jeep made a stop.





We went for a good ride.





Dad let me look under the hood.





A car has many parts.





We can look at the parts under the hood.





We stood side by side to look.





I like the new jeep.
