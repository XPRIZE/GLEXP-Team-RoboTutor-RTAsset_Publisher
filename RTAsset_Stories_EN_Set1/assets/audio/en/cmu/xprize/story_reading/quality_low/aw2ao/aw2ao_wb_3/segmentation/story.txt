{What If a Hawk Came to Get You?} {Project LISTEN} {WORD}


I saw a hawk!





It was huge.





It was a huge hawk.





I saw the huge hawk at the zoo.





It sat on a tree in a big cage.





The hawk had a claw on each foot.





What if the hawk got out?





What if it came to our house?





What would you do if a hawk came and sat on your lawn?





I would hide.





I would crawl under a bush.





So the hawk could not get me with his claw.





That hawk looks mean!





The end.
