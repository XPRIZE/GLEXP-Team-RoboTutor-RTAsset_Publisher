{The Milk Club} {Project LISTEN} {WORD}


I want to start a club.





Sis can join my club.





Don can join.





So can Jean.





Let's drink milk at our club.





But Sis left the milk out.





Did it spoil?





Yes, the milk did spoil.





Then our club can go shop.





We can get milk to drink.





And chips to eat.





Just point the way.





I put a coin in my pants.





Sis has a coin.





Don and Jean have a coin, too.





Jean points the way.





Let's go!





We had to spend all of our coins.





The milk and chips cost a lot!





But now our club can eat!





The end.
