{The Beach Snake} {Project LISTEN} {WORD}


Jen and Jon took a trip.





They went to the beach.





But they found a snake!





Jen said, "Look look a snake!"





The snake said, "Do not point.





It is rude to point."





The snake came close.





So they gave it a coin.





The snake said, "I do not need a coin.





What can a snake do with a coin?"





Jen and Jon said, "You can not spoil our trip."





The snake said, "Then do not spoil mine."





The snake sat in a coil.





It sat on the soil.





Soil is like dirt.





The snake sat in a coil in the soil.





"Let's dump oil on the snake."





Jen and Jon got the oil.





The snake sat in a coil.





The snake said, "Do not dump oil on me!





That is rude!





You came to point at me.





You came to dump oil on me.





You gave me a coin I do not need.





How rude!"





Jen and Jon took a good look.





They said, "You can join us, snake."





The snake came out of his coil.





Jen, Jon, and the snake went to the beach.





The end.
