{Beth Hates Math} {Project LISTEN} {WORD}


Beth has to do math.





She does not like it.





In fact, Beth hates math.





Math makes Beth think too hard.





She does not like to think about math.





Can you help Beth with her math?





One plus one equals...





Two!





Two plus two equals... Four!





Thank you!





Beth is glad.





Thanks for your help.





Now Beth has to take a bath.





The end.
