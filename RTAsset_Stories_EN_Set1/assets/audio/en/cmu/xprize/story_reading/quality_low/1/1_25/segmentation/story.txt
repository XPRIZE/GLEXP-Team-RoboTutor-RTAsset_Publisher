{Our Day at The Zoo} {Zimbili Dlamini and Hlengiwe Zondi} {1}


Today we are going to the zoo.





We are going in dad's car.





We are going to see animals.





Look!
An elephant.
Look!
A lion.





We walk through the whole zoo!





Look!
Ice cream.
Look!
Sweets.





And there is a clown with balloons.





Dad buys us nice things.





Soon we must go home.





We saw many animals today!





We are happy and tired.





I wish every day was like today!
