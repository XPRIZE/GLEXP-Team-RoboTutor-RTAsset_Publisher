{Quite a Quilt} {Project LISTEN} {WORD}


I made a quilt.





It is such a soft quilt.





It has red stripes.





And it has green dots.





The quilt has red spots.





And green stripes.





Mom says, "That's quite a quilt!"





I did not make it quickly.





It takes time.





You can not quit. It takes quite a lot of time to make a quilt.





Soon I will go to sleep with my soft quilt.





The end.
