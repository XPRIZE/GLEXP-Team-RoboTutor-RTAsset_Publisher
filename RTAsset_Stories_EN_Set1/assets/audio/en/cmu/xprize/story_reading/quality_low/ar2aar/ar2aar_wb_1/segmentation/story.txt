{The Car} {Project LISTEN} {WORD}


Mark got in the car.





But it did not start.





The car did not have gas!





Mark went up the road.





He went past a park.





He went past a big log.





Then he got to a farm.





Mark asks for gas.





Mark got a jar of gas from the shed.





Then Mark went to his car.





Past the log, past the park.





The jar of gas is hot!





Did the car start?





Yes, it did!
