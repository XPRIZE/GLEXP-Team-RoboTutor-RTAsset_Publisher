{Rob Got a Bug} {Project LISTEN} {WORD}


Rob got a bug.





A big, fat bug!





The bug ran and ran.





But Rob got it!





Rob got on the bus.





The bug is in his bag.





The big fat bug got on his hand.





Rob asks the bug to sit.





The bug ran and hid.





Rob said, "Bad bug!





Bad!"





Rob asks Bud, "can you grab the bug?"





"Nab the bug!"





"Grab the bug!"





But the fat bug ran fast.





It slid in the mat.





The fat bug dug fast.





Rob had the bug, but it got away!
