{Bathtub Safari} {Tracy Lynn Chemaly and Sarah-Jane Williams} {2}


Bathtime is Jack's favourite part of the day.


'I'll be back in a few moments,' says his mom.





'Make sure to clean behind your ears.'





There's a SWOOSH.
And a swish of a tail.

Jack's bathtub safari begins!

There's a twist and a turn... Something's growing...
It's a...





Tooot!





There's a RUMBLE!
It's going up UP UP...

There's a SPLOSH.
Something bubbles.

AAAAAAH.....


But something's lurking in the background....





ROAR!





'Time to get out.
I hope you're clean and ready for bed.'
