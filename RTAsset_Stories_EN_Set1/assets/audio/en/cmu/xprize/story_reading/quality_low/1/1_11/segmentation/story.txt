{Cow With One Horn} {Sebongile Daniel, Mpho Ntlhanngoe, and Khothatso Ranoosi} {1}


Heeeee!


There is a beautiful cow at home.





It has only one horn, and no tail.





It is fat, with a big stomach.





It is a powerful cow.





The shepherd loves this cow the most.





When the other cattle graze, this one eats alone.





This cow is a fighter.


Other cows leave it alone.





If you met such a cow, what would you do?
