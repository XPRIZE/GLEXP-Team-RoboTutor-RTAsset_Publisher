{The Frog and the Bog} {Project LISTEN} {WORD}


The frog went to the bog.





It is a vast bog.





But the frog met the rat.





And the bat.





The bat had a wig!





The bat, the rat, and the frog went in the sun.





The frog went to swim.





It got wet.





The bat went to twist its wig.





It got twisted in a web.





The rat went to wag its tail.





It felt wet.
