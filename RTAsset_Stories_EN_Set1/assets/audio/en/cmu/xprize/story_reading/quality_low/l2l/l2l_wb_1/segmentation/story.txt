{The Loft} {Project LISTEN} {WORD}


The lad lit the loft.





It was the last loft on the list.





The lad lost the lid.





What did he do?





He hid.





Sis sat on the lid.





The lid was not hid.





The lid was in the loft.





The loft was lit.





Dad was mad.





Sis and the lad got sad.





It is not a fad to lift the lids in lit lofts.
