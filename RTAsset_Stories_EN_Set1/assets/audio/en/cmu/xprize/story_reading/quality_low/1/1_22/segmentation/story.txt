{My Red Ball} {Marion Drew} {1}


Ball.





My ball.





My red ball.





My big red ball.





I kick.





I kick my ball.





I kick my red ball.





I kick my red ball hard!





Where?





Where is my ball?





Where is my ball now?





Where is my red ball now?





It is up.





It is high up.





It is high up in the sky.





It is high up in the sky.


It is over the moon.


It is gone!
