{Fix the Leak} {Project LISTEN} {WORD}


Mom wrote a note for Dad.





What did she write?





She wrote, "fix the sink."





The sink had a leak.





Can Dad fix it?





He took a look at the sink.





Dad had to think.





He got a wrinkle on his head. Dad gets a big wrinkle when he thinks.





Then Dad got a wrench.





A wrench is a tool.





A wrench helps you twist and turn.





Dad had to turn the pipe.





He put the wrench on the pipe.





Then he gave it a yank.





Dad had to wrap his hand on the wrench.





I had to wrap my hand on the pipe.





I held it.





We gave it a good tug.





Dad wrote a note.





He wrote a note in case we had to fix it again.





Did we fix it?





Let's turn on the sink.





No leak!





We did a good job with the wrench.
