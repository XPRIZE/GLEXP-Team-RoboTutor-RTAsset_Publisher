{Sherry in the Market} {Alice Kapolondo} {1}


Sherry likes her school bag.





It is Sherry's birthday.





Sherry at the tax park.





Sherry with her friends.





Sherry at the market with her mum.





Oh!
it is time for food.





Sweet oranges.





But where is mother mother?





I went to buy a birthday gift for you.





Thank you mum!
