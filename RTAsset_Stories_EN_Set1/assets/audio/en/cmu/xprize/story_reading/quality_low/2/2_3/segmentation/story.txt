{Azizi the Doll} {Lawrence A. Konjuro} {2}


This is Azizi.
Azizi is my doll.





I like Azizi because he always smiles.





After I wake up I wash my face.
Then I look for Azizi.





When I find Azizi I brush his hair.





When I eat breakfast I feed Azizi.





When I eat sweets I give one to Azizi.





But Azizi never eats his sweet.
I wonder why!





I walk around the compound picking flowers.





I give a flower to Azizi.
But he never says, "Thank you."





I wash Azizi clean before my mother bathes me.





I dress Azizi in red because I love the colour red.





When I go to sleep, I lay Azizi beside me.
