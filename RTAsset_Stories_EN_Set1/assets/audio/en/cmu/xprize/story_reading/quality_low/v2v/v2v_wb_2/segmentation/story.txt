{Val in the Sun} {Project LISTEN} {WORD}


Val the nun is in the sun.





Val got hot in the sun.





Val asks for a gift.





Val asks for a fan.





Sam got a gift for Val.





Sam got Val a fan!





The sun is hot.





But the fan is on.





Val is not hot!





At last!





Val is glad for the fan.
