{Z is a Letter for us to Read Better} {Project LISTEN} {WORD}


Z is a letter I know you can read.





Zap, Zip, and Zoo are words that you need.





A witch on a broom





goes zippity zoom!





Z is in buzz, the sound made by bees,





but I know two more words that have double Zees.





One of these words is covered in cheese,





and, boy, let me tell you,





it's better than peas.





Pizza is spelled p i z z a.





And there's one more word with two Zees today.





Look at this word





with so many letters.





Let's read together to help learn it better...





m o z z a r e l l a spells mozzarella.





Mozzarella is the name of the cheese on your pizza.





Zap, zip, zoo, buzz, and mozzarella pizza!
