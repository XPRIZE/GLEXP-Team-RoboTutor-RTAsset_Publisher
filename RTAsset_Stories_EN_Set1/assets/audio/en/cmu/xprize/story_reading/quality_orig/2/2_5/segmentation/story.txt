{Bean and Coal} Traditional Tale} {2}


There was a bean and piece of coal.


They were going to another village.





They arrived at the river where they needed to cross.


They found the river deep and flowing fast.





They started to argue about crossing the river.


Then Bean said, "Coal, you cross first."


Then Coal said, "No, you cross first."





They argued until Bean crossed.





When Coal crossed, he fell into the river, "Pshhhhhhhhhhhh!"


Bean laughed until he split into two.
