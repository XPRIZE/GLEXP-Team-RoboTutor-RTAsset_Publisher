{Feet, Hands, and Head!} {Bukheye Mulongo Christopher} {1}


I use my feet to run, jump, and kick.





I use my hands to eat, work, and hug.





But the head is more important than feet or hands.





The head has the eyes.


I see with my eyes.





The head has the nose.


I smell with my nose.





The head has the ears.


I hear with my ears.





The head has the tongue.


I taste salty and sweet.





The head has the mouth.


I speak with my mouth.





The head controls the whole body!
