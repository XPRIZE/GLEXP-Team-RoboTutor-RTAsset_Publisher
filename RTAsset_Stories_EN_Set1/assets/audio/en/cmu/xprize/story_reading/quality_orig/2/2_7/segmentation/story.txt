{Clever Cat} {Ursula Nafula} {2}


In my village, lives Mister Kio.


Mister Kio has a cat called Safi.





When Mister Kio goes to work, he leaves the door open.





Safi sits in the doorway to watch over the house.





When the neighbour's dog comes close, Safi scares him away.





The dog runs away.





When a neighbour knocks at the door, Safi is ready to scratch.





The neighbour turns and runs away.





When Safi is hungry, she closes the door.





Safi eats her food.





Afterwards, Safi jumps onto the sofa and sleeps, "Purr!
Purr!
Purr!"





When Mister Kio returns, Safi stretches happily and welcomes him home.





Mister Kio and Safi sit down, and each of them reads the newspaper.
