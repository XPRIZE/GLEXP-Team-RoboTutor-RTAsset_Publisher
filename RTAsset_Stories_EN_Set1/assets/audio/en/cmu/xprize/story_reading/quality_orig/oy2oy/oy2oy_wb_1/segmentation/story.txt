{My Brother's Toy Train Set} {Project LISTEN} {WORD}


Roy is my brother.





He is five.





He is a good boy.





Mom and Dad spoil him.





That means he gets a lot of gifts.





Roy got a toy.





Dad got him a toy train set.





It made Roy jump for joy!





It made Roy shout, "Oh boy!"





Did I get a toy train set?





No.





I had to help Roy set up his.





I did not jump for joy.





But Roy is a good boy.





He said, "Thanks."





I knelt with Roy to play.





We drove the toy train.





Boy was it fun!





Then Mom said, "Let's go boys!"





They took us to see a real train!





The end.
