{A Goat and a Toad} {Project LISTEN} {WORD}


A goat and a toad ran in the road.





"Stop," I said.





"Do not hit the goat and the toad!





I wish the goat would go."





But the goat just sat.





I said, "Let's help the goat and the toad."





The toad left the road. 





It sat by an oak.





We had to beg the goat.





We had to rush the goat.





We had to grab the goat.





But the goat did not stand up.





The goat just sat.
