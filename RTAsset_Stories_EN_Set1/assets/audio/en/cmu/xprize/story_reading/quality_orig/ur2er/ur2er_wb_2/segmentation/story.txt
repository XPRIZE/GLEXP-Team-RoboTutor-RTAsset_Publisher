{Whose Turn Is It?} {Project LISTEN} {WORD}


"My turn!





My turn!"





The girl says, "My turn!"





She can shout loud!





"My turn!"





The girl is at the fair.





She wants to play a game.





But she has to wait in line.





Sit and wait.





The girl sits on the curb.





She sits and sits.





"I do not like this curb," she says.





"This curb hurts.





It hurts to sit on this curb.





When is it my turn?"





She gets a hot dog.





"This hot dog is burnt!"





She gets a Coke.





"This Coke has dirt in it."





The girl is mad.





"It's my turn!"





She gets up from the curb.





Now it is her turn.
