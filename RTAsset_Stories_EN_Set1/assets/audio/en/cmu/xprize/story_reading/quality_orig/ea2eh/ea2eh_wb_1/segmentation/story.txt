{My Plants} {Project LISTEN} {WORD}


I had five plants.





I put them on the porch.





I spread them in a line.





The plants need sun.





They need sun and water for health.





But a big storm came.





The storm had a lot of rain.





The storm made hail.





The hail went thud on the roof.





My plants got wet.





Too wet.





I meant to put them in my room.





But I left them on the porch.





Are they dead?





Not yet.





I need to care for the health of my plants.





The plants are in bad health.





I hope they are not dead!
